# Repository for "Advanced Programming and Problem-Solving Strategies in C

This repository contains code examples, exercises, and theoretical concepts covered in the book "Advanced Programming and Problem-Solving Strategies in C, Part II: Algorithms and Data Structures" by S. Quer. The book, an essential resource for advanced students and software development professionals, dives into complex problem solving using the C programming language.

## Repository Structure

- `FIRST-PART-BOOK`: Contains code and examples from the first chapters of the book, revising basic C constructs and problem-solving strategies.
- `MOST-OF-THEORY-CONCEPTS`: Includes detailed theoretical concepts of algorithms and data structures as discussed throughout the book.
- `SECOND-PART-BOOK`: Features advanced code samples from the latter chapters of the book, focusing on dynamic memory, recursion, and Abstract Data Types (ADTs).
- `TREE-QUESTIONS`: Stores solutions and discussions related to specific problem sets from the book, particularly those involving tree data structures.

## Book Overview

The book aims to provide a thorough understanding of advanced algorithms and data structures through the C programming language. It covers:
- Dynamic memory management
- Pointers, arrays, and matrix operations
- Implementation of linked lists in various forms
- Recursive algorithms and their applications in sorting and combinatorial problems
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and their practical implementations

Examples in this repository demonstrate various ways to tackle complex problems and enhance software engineering skills. Each example and piece of code is crafted to emphasize clarity and good programming practices.
